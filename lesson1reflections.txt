lesson_1_reflections are here. 
cd means current directory
val@valpc is mine. 
fc = file compare
these are going to be lines of text that will hopefully show
up if i'm able to get notepadd++ to be happy with GitBash.


add more text here on how having the second version of something 
archived automatically is totally kick-ass. 

VERSION CONTROL
commit: each unique save (multi-file).
diff: differences between 2 commits KEEP COMMITS SMALL
ONE COMMIT PER LOGICAL CHANGE. 

repository: the versions of each commit. commit holds
all files in your thing.
copy paste are different -> LOOK at shortcut comands again to figure it out. 

git clone: all the previous 

git checkout: kinda like resetting all files at a previous commit. 

have the other custom ones downloaded, not setup because
i don't understand home directories and calling things 
from command lines as well as i should yet.
